Program 3      JAVA             Class Implementation          100 Points + 25 Extra Credit
DUE DATE:   APRIL 9, 2015      Programming Project   # 3   Page 247(4th e) Page 253(5th e)
Write the program described in the textbook. Summary is as follows:
1.	Define a class Odometer that will be used to track fuel and mileage for an automobile.
2.	The class will have the following attributes:
-	Instance variables to track the miles driven and fuel efficiency.
-	Mutator methods to:
a)	Reset the odometer to zero miles.
b)	Set the fuel efficiency. This is in miles per gallon (mpg).
c)	Accept the miles driven for a trip and add it to the odometer total.
-	Accessor method to return the number of gallons of gas that the vehicle has consumed since the odometer was last reset.
The program plan outline should follow this structure:
Class Odometer     Public Variables     Private Variables
   Set FuelEfficiency       Miles             Reset       FuelEfficiency
   LogMiles    GasConsumed
INPUT/OUTPUT
Hard code the mpg and miles travelled into the program.  Example:
Trip1 – FuelEfficiency(35)     LogMiles(100)  -> output GasConsumed “After 100 miles…”
              LogMiles(50) ->  output GasConsumed “After another 50 miles…”
Reset… 
Trip2 - FuelEfficiency(19)     LogMiles(100)  -> output GasConsumed “After 100 miles…”
LogMiles(50)  ->  output GasConsumed “After another 50 miles…”
EXTRA CREDIT  25 Points: Make the above program interactive to accept keyboard input with a menu of commands. IE: Enter the mpg, miles logged, reset, new trip, etc...
